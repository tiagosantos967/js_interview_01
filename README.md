# Description
Difficulty **7/10**

Inside `src/strange-object.js` you can find a very strange Java Script object.   
It has a property `value` that can either be a function or a string.

# Problem
Fix the `strange-object.js` so that the tests inside `tests/index.test.js` pass.   
Do not change the tests file!

# Expected Output
After running `npm run`, the terminal should show:

```
> mocha "tests/index.test.js"

  ✓ should print 'Hello'
  ✓ should print 'World'

  2 passing (5ms)

```
